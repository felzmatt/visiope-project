# visiope-project
Train a model for traffic light recognition and install it on Raspberry PI4 in order to make an Arduino UNO driven robot reacts to STOP and GO signals.

# How we plan to do that
By training the model using TensorFlow and the converting it to TensorFlowLite so that it can be installed on a Raspberry PI4 which receives the images to evaluate, the world seen by the robot, by a webcam through USB and sends electronic commands to the Arduino board.
